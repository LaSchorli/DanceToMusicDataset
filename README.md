# Dataset

The dataset contains synchronized music and motion data of four different types of dance: Improvisation, Balllet, Hip-Hop and Swing. The structure of the data is adopted from this project: https://github.com/Music-to-dance-motion-synthesis/dataset.

In addition to the raw data, the COMPLETE folders contain numpy folders with the post-processed data. Look into this paper for further formation about the postprocess.
